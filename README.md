# Researchify
Research smarter, discover faster.

The researchify is designed to streamline and expedite the process of finding research papers. Leveraging the powerful combination of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Xata](https://xata.io/), the application provides users with a user-friendly and efficient platform for accessing academic literature.
