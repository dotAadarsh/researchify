### Dataset

 Arxiv.org AI Research Papers Dataset [â†—](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasirabdaali/arxivorg-ai-research-papers-dataset)
 
This dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of AI. It can be used to track the latest research trends, identify emerging research areas, and find relevant papers. This dataset contains the metadata for 10,000 research papers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) that were published on arXiv.org.

### Set up - Xata

If you are new to Xata I'd suggest you read [Getting started with Xata | Aadarsh (aadarshkannan.tech)](https://www.aadarshkannan.tech/posts/Getting-Started-With-Xata/). Sign up at [Xata - The serverless database built for modern development](https://xata.io/) and start creating a database and make a note of Xata API and Database URL which we will need later on to connect with our database through Python SDK.

### Import CSV data

Once you create a database you will see import CSV data. Click on that and upload the downloaded dataset. Xata can guess column types from your data automatically, and if needed to change you can choose the dropdown and select the desired type. Once the import is completed, you will be able to see the table.

### Search Engine

As you insert data into Xata, it is automatically indexed for full-text search. Try exploring the Search Engine feature which you can find in the left side pane. Try changing various parameters and see what happens. Click on Get the code snippet, select the language Python and copy the code. We will be using this snippet to build the search feature through our app.

### AskAI

Now go to the playground and try out different operations you want to perform through programming. [Xata's `ask` endpoint](https://xata.io/docs/sdk/ask) utilizes current data from your Xata database and leverages Xata's search functionalities to retrieve pertinent information from our database. It then utilizes the OpenAI's ChatGPT API to understand your query and produce natural language responses. Run the following example in the playground and see the result. 

```Python
result = xata.data().ask("Table_name", "Question")
```
